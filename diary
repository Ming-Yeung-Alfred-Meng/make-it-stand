  Although there did not seem to be a problem in the early versions of inner_carving.cpp, using a function to output a
  custom lambda expression seemed to be susceptible to bugs in general. Data are passed into the generator function by
  reference, then captured by the lambda expression by reference. If the data persists throughout the course of the
  usage of the lambda expression, I do not think there would be a problem. But, if the data are created in the generator
  function instead of passed into the generator function, I conjecture that the lambda expression no longer points to
  valid memory location, leading to bugs.

  Maybe there is still room for optimization of the comparing process in the sorting of voxels. Maybe each voxel's
  signed distance can be precomputed and stored with the voxel 3D location or index in a tuple, then sorting the tuples
  suffices.

  update_center_of_mass(): The numerical imprecision may be concerning. The largest component-wise error detected when
  comparing its result against that of igl::centroid's was 0.00013.
